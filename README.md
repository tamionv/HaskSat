# HaskSat

This project contains an implementation of a haskell-based CDCL algorithm. The repository is a cabal package, so it can be built using cabal commands. Input and output is done via `stdin`/`stdout`, and uses the DIMACS satisfiability format. The program only accepts formulae in conjunctive normal form.
